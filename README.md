https://tympanus.net/codrops/2020/12/08/horizontal-smooth-scroll-layouts/ -  :steam_locomotive: Starting off with cool s***. Horizontal scrolls are all the rage right now and this shows off 5 different variations using the locomotive scroll (made by locomotive design agency who are pretty cool). There is both a button for the demos to play around with them and more importantly you can get the source too so can use them in any of your own projects!

https://coolcssanimation.com/how-to-trigger-a-css-animation-on-scroll/ - :rocket: Another scroller, but this time animations on scroll. Another huge trend right now but most examples I have seen only play the animation once. This however shows a method to allow the animation to play whenever the item comes into the viewport.

https://javascript.plainenglish.io/react-learning-roadmap-for-2021-a1c0f7456186 - :_react: Finally something to really get your pulses racing, a react roadmap! Wow! But seriously, lots of pointers in here about different react tech to use and pick up in various scenarios.
I know everyone already absolutely cannot wait until the next update, alas the best things come to those who wait.
See you next Wednesday. :call_me_hand:
